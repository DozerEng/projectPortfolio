    The goal of the Smart Life Home Automation project is to turn the average home into a smart home. 
    The Project began as a capstone project as a part of the electrical engineering technology program at Fanshawe College (2017/2018) and is continuing to add more devices and features.
    <br><br>
    Origionally the project contained 3 devices: A smart door lock, a smart light switch, and a smart power bar. 
    Now there are an array of devices including a server running on a BeagleBone Black, all previous devices, and an array of devices and sensors creating meta data which is stored and presented on this site.
    <br><br>
    The goal is to be able to use motion and thermal sensors to track inhabitants and to control the devices in a room based on the occupancy.

    <h2>Using the Floor Plan</h2>
    <p>
        The goal of the <i>Smart Life</i> project has always been to make your home smarter but to do it in an easy to manage way. 
        Below you can see my apartments floor plan.
        The standard room temperature is 23 degress celcius and rooms at that temperature exactly are a standard colour. 
        Rooms which are colder or warmer than this room temperature have a slight blue or red hue to them to indicate this difference.

        Sample floor plan (Non-functioning)
        <br>
        Note: The bedroom is above room temperature and the kitchen is below, while the living and dining rooms are at room temperature.
    </div>
    <p>
        The floor plan is the centerpiece of the system, current and upcoming features include:
    </p>
        <ul class='generalLists'>
            <li>All devices in proper locations with current status (Online/Offline)</li>
            <li>Device state (On/off or locked/unlocked)</li>
            <li>Location relevant data (Temperature exactly where measured)</li>
            <li>Interactive information, click any piece of data for additional information</li>
            <li>Location of residents and pets </li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        Many of these features are in development and feedback or recommendations is always welcome! 
        Please see the contact link at the bottom of the page to pass on your useful advice.
